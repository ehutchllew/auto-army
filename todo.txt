1. Need to dynamically render `tileLayer` vs `objectgroup` in the `map1.json` file (look at GenericTileset).
2. Each tile or object should contain info about its:
	a. image
	b. height
	c. width
	d. position
	e. properties
	f. transformation?
	g. collider?
3. Need to think about how entitites/objects moving on the map interact with each tile.
4. Perhaps at the initial draw phase, iterate over entire map, assign special structs to tiles where needed and then assign these special structs to a map/dict with (x,y) as key. If a body is moving across the map it checks against this map/dict to determine if it should interact (blocked, movement differential, attackable, etc.)
