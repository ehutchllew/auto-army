1. Need to dynamically render `tileLayer` vs `objectgroup` in the `map1.json` file.
2. Each tile or object should contain info about its:
	a. image
	b. height
	c. width
	d. position
	e. properties
	f. transformation?
	g. collider?
3. Need to think about how entitites/objects moving on the map interact with each tile.
