1. Need to think about how entitites/objects moving on the map interact with each tile.
2. Think about abstracting the repetitive logic when creating each LayerObject entity (coords, dimensions, etc.)
3. Convert the elevated terrain that is NOT of type Cliff to a normal tile layer instead of object layer.
4. Perhaps at the initial draw phase, iterate over entire map, assign special structs to tiles where needed and then assign these special structs to a map/dict with (x,y) as key. If a body is moving across the map it checks against this map/dict to determine if it should interact (blocked, movement differential, attackable, etc.)
